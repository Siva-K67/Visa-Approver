**Config-Driven Rule Evaluation System (Java)**

This is a **Java-only exercise**.  
No frameworks, no Spring, no databases.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build a **config-driven rule engine** that evaluates whether a traveler requires a visa for a given country.

### This tests:
- Java fundamentals
- Clean OOP
- Enums
- Collections
- Defensive coding
- Real-world thinking

---

## 🧩 Functional Requirements

### Inputs
- Country (enum)
- PassportCountry (enum)
- TravelPurpose (enum)
- StayDuration (int, days)

### Output

A `VisaDecision` object containing:
- `boolean visaRequired`
- `VisaType` (enum)
- `List<DocumentType>`
- `int estimatedProcessingDays`
- `List<String> warnings`

---

## 📁 Data (Config-Based)

Rules must be loaded from **JSON or YAML**.

---

## 🛠️ Technical Constraints (Very Important)

### Must Use
- Java 8+
- Enums (`Country`, `VisaType`, `DocumentType`)
- Immutable DTOs
- Java Collections
- Optional (where appropriate)

### Must NOT Use
- Spring / Hibernate
- Databases
- Hardcoded logic per country
- Reflection hacks

---

## 🧠 Required Design Elements

Interns must implement:
- `RuleLoader` (reads config)
- `RuleRepository` (stores rules)
- `VisaRuleEvaluator` (core logic)
- `VisaDecision` (output object)

---

## 🧪 Test Scenarios (They Must Write These)

- Valid rule match
- No rule found
- Multiple rule conflict
- Invalid input
- Missing config fields

---

# Visa Rule Evaluation System (Core Java)

## Overview

This project is a **config-driven visa rule engine** built using Core Java.  
It decides whether a traveler needs a visa based on travel details and rules defined in a JSON file.

The main idea is to **separate rules from code**, so visa policies can be changed without modifying Java logic.

---

## Input

The user provides:
- Destination country
- Passport country
- Travel purpose
- Stay duration (in days)

These inputs are combined into a `TravelRequest` object.

---

## Rules

Visa rules are stored in a JSON file (`visa-rules.json`).

Each rule defines:
- When it applies (country, purpose, stay duration)
- What the decision should be (visa required or not)
- Visa type
- Warning messages

Rules are checked **in order**, and the **first matching rule** is applied.

---

## Output

The system returns a `VisaDecision` containing:
- Whether a visa is required
- Type of visa
- Any warning messages

---

## Project Structure

```text
src/
├── Main.java              // User input and output
├── model/                 // Enums and data objects
├── service/               // Visa evaluation logic
├── repository/            // Rule loading and storage
visa-rules.json            // Visa rules (config)
```

---

## How It Works

1. User enters travel details via console
2. Rules are loaded from JSON
3. Rules are matched against the input
4. The first valid rule produces the decision
5. Result is printed to the console

---

## Testing

Test scenarios are implemented using a **simple test runner class**.

They cover:
- Valid rule match
- No rule found
- Multiple rule conflict
- Invalid input
- Missing rule fields

Tests create input programmatically (no user input).

---

## Tech Used

- Java 8+
- Enums
- Collections
- Optional
- JSON-based configuration

---

## Summary

This project demonstrates how a **rule-based system** can be built in Core Java by keeping logic generic and rules external.
